If you decide to experiment with Long Polling make sure that.
1. You have enabled it in "Synchronisation and sound settings"
2. Connection to server is less than php script execution time. 29 seconds is good start.
3. Internal message sync interval is not very small. 1.5 second is good start. If you want more real time appearance. Reduce it to half second or so.

Good luck with your experimenting.
